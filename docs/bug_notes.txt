Views of the Bugs data

Types of views:

over Time (line chart)
	(1) count of bugs
	(2) sens to drugs by bug [can't do this]
	bugs.count
	bugs.virulence (what is this?)
	drugs.sensitivity
		total (so know if stock has expired, or general trend)
		by bug (so know which is best empicic therapy)
	md.floor - so know where he's been
	
geographically (contour plot)
	(1) num incidents (sum unique pts?)
	(2) avg sensitivity
	(e.g. floor vs room)
	md
	bug
	drug
	month
	mrn?	[what is an MD's case-load?]
	
Bug vs Sensitivity (Bar chart)
	month
	md
	floor

	[best empiric med for a given md/time/location]	


Housekeeping
	location of resistant rooms at a given time
	
Nursing
	room occupancy
	MRSA & non-MRSA sharing a room
		? geographic?
	isolate resistant organisms (resistance x loc)
	acuity level (also resistance x loc)
	
MD
	locate patients (mrn x loc)
	acuity of pts (resistance x loc filtered by md)
	best empiric drug (bug vs sens)
	

/*** GEOGRAPHICS ****/
Show sensitivitity and count by room?
test1.pl is template for presenting geographical view
by MD, bug, drug, month
may need to implement a color scale for 

Values by room in geographic
	mrn
	count(bug)
	avg(ratio)
		
N.B. - for patients with 2 bugs, need to know how many drugs will kill BOTH - that is level of sensitivity!
	- Also, not just number of effective drugs, but percent per bug in a given patient?
	- How do I calc number of drugs needed, and filter this based on bug type?
	
Sensitivity
	-Minimum number of drugs to which sensitive - warning of 0, 1, or 2
	-by drug - don't need geography, unless means not washed
		-could add summary rows to Floor/Room? - for total number, ...?
