<P><B>Who We Are</B>:

<DIV>
	<UL>
		<LI>We are a 200 bed, tertiary care facility, which has been operating at capacity for the last five months.
		<LI>The second and third floors are ICUs.
		<LI>We have five attending <A HREF="help.htm#MD_abbr">MDs</A> on staff at all times, along with a team of nurses,
		epidemiologists, administrators, and support staff.
		<LI>We are doing are best to cure our patients of any infections (<A HREF="help.htm#Bug_abbr">bugs</A>) they may
		have, but have noticed an increase in Acinetobacter over the last five months.
	</UL>
	<P><B>Why This Site?</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>We needed a convenient way for all our staff to access information about the patients we are caring for, the
		status of their infections, and any trends that appear over time.
		<LI>We chose to standardize on a relatively-consistent interface so as to reduce training costs and foster communication
		among different disciplines as they learned to use the system.
	</UL>
	<P><B>What This Site Offers?</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Customized interfaces for our six classes of users: <A HREF="help.htm#Patients_help" ONCLICK="parent.Frame1.location.href='patient_menu.htm';">Patients</A>
		, <A HREF="help.htm#Doctors_help" ONCLICK="parent.Frame1.location.href='md_menu.htm';">Clinicians</A> , <A HREF="help.htm#Nurses_help"
		ONCLICK="parent.Frame1.location.href='nurse_menu.htm';">Nurses</A>, <A HREF="help.htm#Epidemiologists_help" ONCLICK="parent.Frame1.location.href='md_menu.htm';">Epidemiologists</A>,
		<A HREF="help.htm#Housekeeping_help" ONCLICK="parent.Frame1.location.href='housekeeper_menu.htm';">Housekeeping</A>,
		<A HREF="help.htm#Administators_help" ONCLICK="parent.Frame1.location.href='admin_menu.htm';">Administrators</A>.
		<LI>Five consistent ways to view the data: <A HREF="help.htm#Patient_view">Single Patient</A>, <A HREF="help.htm#Doctor_view">Doctor's
		List</A>, <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">Floor-Plan</A>, <A HREF="#Antibiogram_view">Antibio</A><A HREF="help.htm#Antibiogram_view">g</A><A
		HREF="#Antibiogram_view">ram</A>, <A HREF="#Temporal_view">Temporal Trends</A>.
		<LI>The ability to easily and rapidly get a <B>global</B> view of the data.
		<UL>
			<LI>The  <A HREF="help.htm#Patient_view">Single Patient</A> view shows all of the pertinent information for a patient,
			and helps the MD choose the most effective and least costly antibiotic.
			<LI>The <A HREF="help.htm#Doctor_view">Doctor's List</A> view lets the clinician see all of their patients, color
			coded by the severity of their infection; as well as a pertinent summary of their lab tests (their cultures and
			sensitivity profiles).
			<LI>The <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">Floor-Plan</A> view shows where each of the patients are located,
			as well as overall totals by floor, room, and for the entire hospital.
			<UL>
				<LI>When looking at a single month (the <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">detail-view</A>), the MD can
				see the medical record numbers (mrns) for each patient in a room; as well as the list of infections they have,
				and the severity of the worst infection.
				<LI>The  <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">detail-view</A> also lets the nurses see where their patients
				are located; assess who needs to be isolated or moved; and help balance their workloads.
				<LI>The <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">detail-view</A> also lets housekeepers know which rooms need
				special cleaning procedures.
				<LI>When looking at the multi-month view (the summary-view), the MD or administrator can see how many infections
				there were, sorted by floor, bug, and MD; and can assess how bad those infections are.
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<LI>The ablity to filter each view by all relevant variables so as to zoom in on the regions of interest.
		<UL>
			<LI>The user is given the locus of control and the ability to rapidly, reversibly, and incrementally change the
			type of view, and the variables that contribute to it.  Each action causes an immediate update of the right-hand
			view.
			<LI>Errors are prevented by giving pick-lists; and gracefully caught in the case of the MRN number-entry box by
			giving informative feedback when invalid MRN numbers are selected.
			<LI>Copious help links are available.
		</UL>
		<LI>The abilty to navigate by scent
		<UL>
			<LI>Hyperlinks at the top of each view allow the user to navigate to neighboring data - e.g. the surrounding months,
			floors, bugs, and MDs.
			<LI>Hyperlinks connecting the views let the user quickly navigate to related material without having to move the
			cursor all the way back to the left frame.
		</UL>
		<LI>The ability to get details on demand from each view:
		<UL>
			<LI>From the <A HREF="help.htm#Patient_view">Single Patient</A> view, you can jump to the <A HREF="help.htm#Doctor_view">Doctor's
			List</A>, <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">Floor-Plan</A>, and <A HREF="#Antibiogram_view">Antibio</A><A
			HREF="help.htm#Antibiogram_view">g</A><A HREF="#Antibiogram_view">ram</A> views.
			<LI>From the <A HREF="help.htm#Doctor_view">Doctor's List</A> view, you jump to the <A HREF="help.htm#Patient_view">Single
			Patient</A>, and <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">Floor-Plan</A>, views.
			<LI>From the  <A HREF="help.htm#Floor-plan_view_detail">Floor-Plan</A> view, you can jump to the <A HREF="help.htm#Patient_view">Single
			Patient</A> views.
		</UL>
		<LI>Shortcuts for experts
		<UL>
			<LI>All of the <B>Fine-Tune</B> pick lists support single key entry; so the user can type the first letter of the
			desired option, and they simply type the TAB key to have the view refreshed.
			<LI>The <B>Select-A-View </B>dialog puts the view-selection radio buttons next to hyperlinks which jump the cursor
			to the <B>Fine-Tune</B> filters, thus minimizing motion and maximizing the speed of querying.
		</UL>
		<LI>A comprehensive <A HREF="help.htm#top">help</A> page which:
		<UL>
			<LI>helps the user log-in
			<LI>shows them screen-shots of views they can see
			<LI>explains how to navigate among the views
			<LI>provides both user- and view-oriented instructions.
		</UL>
